We constructed several large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are offered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems - Volume 1}, pages = {649â€“657}, numpages = {9}, location = {Montreal, Canada}, series = {NIPS'15} }
